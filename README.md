# Huffman Encoding
A particular type of optimal prefix code that is used for lossless data compression. Note that this project wasn't taken seriously, but it probably can help you for creating your own Huffman encoding. Also, this project doesn't include the huffman decoding, so you must implement it to get the encoded data back.

A great explanation of huffman coding: https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece264/17au/hw/HW13?alt=huffman
